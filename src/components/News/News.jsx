	//     "text": "The preamble of the Indian constitution is key to understanding the fundamental principles, values, and objectives to which the people of India aspired to achieve for which the Constitution was adopted as a means to usher the “social revolution”. Indian Constitution is the longest written Constitutions in the world whose 73 years of journey is a remarkable story for the Indian Republic. Its preamble expresses the ideals woven around the constitutional provisions whose realization is key for making India a free and just society. The ambit and goals of the Indian Constitution may be understood through the meaning of every word of the preamble. Therefore, it is important to explore the concept and characteristics of the preamble, its evolution, and justification of its inclusion in the Indian Constitution. What is Preamble? As per Oxford Dictionary, “preamble” is defined as “the introductory part of a statute or deed, stating its purpose, aims, and justification”. The word preamble in English evolved from “praeambulus”, which means “going before”. The preamble in a nutshell is a statement that is often used in the beginning of the Constitution or any other legislation to express the constitutional and legislative aspirations and justifications. Preamble of Indian Constitution The Indian Independence movement was based on cherished ideals which later became the foundational principles of the Indian Constitution. Constituent Assembly had the advantage to learn and unlearn through the comparison of several Constitutions adopted by Nation-States across the globe till then. Therefore, the framers of the Indian Constitution in a systematic manner discovered and compared those principles and adopted some of those as per the necessity and suitability for India. Those values mirror the preamble of the Indian Constitution. Characteristics of Preamble under Indian Constitution “We the People”, the initial three words in Indian Constitution were borrowed from the preamble of the United States Constitution, which signifies that political sovereignty lies within the people of India. The preamble declares that the people of India have taken a solemn resolution to make India a sovereign power of its own, having a democratic and republican character, whose governance will be ushered through secular means and to achieve socialist goals. “Socialist” and “Secular” words were added in the preamble by the 42nd Amendment to Indian Constitution in 1976. The preamble of the Indian Constitution also proclaims that for its citizens, socio-economic and political justice will be secured, and each citizen shall have liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship. The preamble signifies the aspiration for equality of status and opportunity for Indian citizens. Most importantly, the preamble prescribes maintaining the unity and integrity of India coupled with fraternal bonds among the people. The preamble also emphasizes human dignity which was constitutionalized under the Indian Constitution as one of the facets of the Right to life under Article 21, emanated through judicial interpretations. How did Preamble emerged in Indian Constitution? It was the Objectives Resolution moved in the Constituent Assembly on the 13th of December 1946 by Jawaharlal Nehru which became the primary source of the preamble. The Objectives Resolution was adopted on the 22nd of January, 1947 by the Assembly. After extensive debates on the wording of the preamble, the final version of the preamble was adopted by the Assembly on the 26th of November, 1949, and came into force on the 26th of January, 1950. Why Preamble is required? The preamble of the Indian constitution is key to understanding the fundamental principles, values, and objectives to which the people of India aspired to achieve for which the Constitution was adopted as a means to usher the “social revolution” (Granville Austin, 1976). The significance of the preamble is that it functions as a guiding light in the interpretation of the Constitution's texts if ambiguities or conflicts persist among the provisions. In In Re: Berubari Union case, the Supreme Court of India, though, accepted its importance as “a key to open the mind” of Constitution makers, but the Court did not accept it as an integral part of the Constitution like any other constitutional provision. In Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973), the Supreme Court of India, however, held that the preamble is a part of the Constitution which may be amended like any other constitutional provision, subject to the condition that it does not violate the “Basic Structure of Constitution”. The importance of the preamble was recognized by the Court in this case by holding the view that it may be a yardstick to bring an amendment to the Constitution. In Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975), the Supreme Court of India held that “If there is a part of our Constitution which deserves greater devotion than any other part of it, it is certainly the preamble to our Constitution”. The Court further went on to say that “Preambles of written Constitutions are intended primarily to reflect the hopes and aspirations of people. They resonate the ideal which the nation seeks to achieve”. The preamble is, though, an integral and significant part of the Constitution, but it cannot be treated either as a source of power or limitation. It is not an operationalized constitutional provision that may be enforced in a positivist sense. Its importance lies in its meticulous use as sunlight whose presence is enough to bring clarity and precision amidst conflicting zones of constitutional interpretation.

Try out the MCQs and check your answers provided towards the end of the article. India becomes world's most populous nation WHY IN NEWS? — India is now the most populous country in the world, having overtaken China in population, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) said in its State of World Population (SOWP) report, ‘8 Billion Lives, Infinite Possibilities', released on April 19. In November 2022, the UN had announced that the world's population had crossed the 8 billion mark. KEY TAKEAWAYS Esha Roy explains: — The UNFPA has said the population of the world is 8,045 million, of which the largest share (65 per cent) is of people between the ages of 15 and 64 years, followed by those in the 10-24 years group (24 per cent). 10 per cent of the population is above 65 years of age. — According to the UN's 2022 report, the world's two most populous regions are Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, with 2.3 billion people, representing 29 per cent of the global population; and Central and Southern Asia, with 2.1 billion (26 per cent). China and India accounted for the largest populations in these regions, with more than 1.4 billion each in 2022. — Central and Southern Asia is expected to become the most populous region in the world by 2037. — Earlier UN reports had said that the population growth in South Asia will begin to decline before 2100. The latest UN projections suggest that the global population could grow to around 8.5 billion in 2030, 9.7 billion in 2050 and 10.4 billion in 2100. — More than half of the projected increase in global population up to 2050 will be concentrated in eight countries — the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines and the United Republic of Tanzania. Countries of sub-Saharan Africa are expected to continue growing through 2100 and to contribute more than half of the global population increase anticipated through 2050. What is the outlook for population growth? — The 2023 report has said that while numbers will continue to grow for several decades, latest projections suggest that the rate of global population growth has fallen, and has been at less than 1 per cent since 2020. — This is largely due to declining fertility; around two thirds of people live in a country or area with a total fertility rate at or below 2.1 children per woman (widely considered the “replacement fertility” rate, also called “zero-growth fertility” rate). In 1950 the global fertility rate stood at 5. — The UN has said that already 60% of the world's population lives in a region where the fertility rate is below replacement level, up from 40% in 1990. It is international migration that is now the driver of growth in many countries, with 281 million people living outside their country of birth in 2020. Migration has also occurred due to war, famines, and other catastrophes, it has pointed out. — South Asia clocks some of the highest emigration trends, according to the report, with India seeing an estimated net outflow of 3.5 million between 2010 and 2021. Pakistan has the highest net flow of migrants of 16.5 million during the same period. — Central and Southern Asia is expected to become the most populous region in the world by 2037. (AP Photo) — Despite the continuing decline in the average number of births per woman, the total annual number of births has remained stable at around 140 million since the late 1980s “due to the youthful age distribution of the global population”, the UN said in an earlier report. — In 2021, 134 million babies were born worldwide. In the future, the number of newborns is expected to slightly increase to reach 138 million annually between 2040 and 2045, despite the continuous decline in the average number of births per woman. — In 2021, most births worldwide occurred in the two most populous regions—Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. How has life expectancy contributed to the global population growth? — One of the reasons for population growth globally flagged by the UNFPA has been that of increasing life expectancy. Fertility rates have been dropping in various parts of the world, as have mortality rates all over the world, with better access to health care and improving standards of living. This also means that parts of the world, such as Japan, have a rapidly ageing population. — The 2023 report finds that life expectancy among men now stands at 71 years while among women it stands at 76 years. — Globally, life expectancy reached 72.8 years in 2019, an increase of almost 9 years since 1990, the UN said in its 2022 report. — Further reductions in mortality are projected to result in an average longevity of around 77.2 years globally in 2050. The share of the global population aged 65 years or above is projected to rise from 10 per cent in 2022 to 16 per cent in 2050. — By 2050, the number of persons aged 65 years and above is expected to be more than double that of 5 year olds and the same as 12 year olds, the UN has said. — Once fertility rates drop in high fertility regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, the global population will start to decline. Where does India stand in the big population picture? — The UN report states that India now has 1,428.6 million people and is the most populous country in the world, outstripping China's population. — As much as 68% of India's population belongs to the 15-64 years category, and 26% in the 10-24 years group, making India one of the youngest countries in the world. — However, the fertility rate in India has been steadily dropping. The National Family Health 5 Survey (2019-21) found that India attained a Total Fertility Rate of 2.0 for the first time, less than the replacement level of 2.1, falling from 2.2 in NFHS 4 (2015-16). — Experts say that India's large population is a result of the “population momentum” from earlier decades, and that the country's population is likely to start its decline closer to 2050. — The increased use of contraceptive methods, spacing of pregnancies, access to health care and the impetus to family planning, besides increasing wealth and education, has contributed to the rate of growth of population slowing. “India's growth rate stood at 2.3 per cent in 1972, which has dropped to less than 1 per cent now. In this period, the number of children each Indian woman has during her lifetime has come down from about 5.4 to less than 2.1 now. This means that we have attained the Replacement Fertility Rate, at which a population exactly replaces itself from one generation to the next. This shows that usage of modern contraceptives is rising across the country,''Executive Director of the Population Foundation of India, Poonam Muttreja, said. — Life expectancy for men in India is the same as the global life expectancy of 71 years, while it is marginally lower for women at 74 years. Is India's large population a good thing or a bad thing? — Experts have been talking about the opportunity of India's “demographic dividend”. What this means is that with 68% of its population as youth, and working population, India could have one of the largest workforces in the world, giving it a global advantage. — The population in many countries, like Japan and South Korea, are on the decline. A declining fertility rate, women not having children, is accompanied by an ageing population, and one that is out of the workforce. This is the situation that India now needs to capitalise on to spur its economic growth further, by educating and skilling its youth, and providing this skilled labour to countries which will be in dire need of such a work force in the near future. FYI: What else you should know? Amitabh Sinha Explains: Faster growth than India's own estimates — The most reliable figures for India's population comes from the Census that happens every 10 years. The last Census took place in 2011, and the 2021 exercise had to be postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The process has not yet been initiated. — The 2011 Census had put India's population at 1,210 million (121.08 crore, 1,210,854,977 to be exact). In July 2020, the Census office had released population projections for years 2012-2036, which remain the official estimates of India's current population. — According to these projections, India's population in 2023 was expected to be only 1,388 million (about 139 crore), significantly less than what the UNFPA's State of World Population report and several other estimates have been suggesting. In fact, according to these projections, India's population even in 2026 would be smaller than what UNFPA has estimated for the middle of this year. — Improvements in life expectancy and decline in mortality rates, both of them positive indicators, could be some of the major reasons for the faster-than-expected growth in population in the short term. — The UNFPA report says that if India's population continues to grow at the current pace — a shade below one per cent every year — it would double from the present value in the next 75 years. That would be the case with global population as well, currently slightly above 8 billion. Of course, both India's and the world's population are expected to stabilise much ahead of that. Delayed Census — An authoritative assessment of India's current population has been hampered by an intriguing delay in carrying out the Census 2021 exercise. The pandemic is no longer an obstacle in carrying out any activity, but even more than a year after normalcy has been restored, there are no indications of the process being initiated in the near future. The Census exercise, being carried out every 10 years since the 1870s, has never been disrupted for this long. — The government is yet to reveal its plans for Census 2021. When asked about it in Parliament, it has maintained that itanted to conduct the Census on time, but was forced by circumstances to postpone it.'The intent of the government for conducting Census 2021 was notified in the Gazette of India on 28th March, 2019 (before the emergence of the pandemic). Subsequently, a notification under Citizenship Rules was published in the Gazette of India on 31st July, 2019 to prepare and update the Population Register along with the first phase of Census, i.e. Houselisting and Housing Census. — However, due to the outbreak of Covid19 pandemic, the conduct of Census 2021, updating of National Population Register and the related field activities have been postponed until further orders,” Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai said in response to a written Parliament question in Lok Sabha on February 7 this year. There has been no further official word on this. — In December last year, the office of the Registrar General of India had pushed the deadline to freeze administrative boundaries, the first step in the Census exercise, to June 30 this year. That means that the work is unlikely to begin at least till the end of June. With General Elections scheduled for next year, the Census exercise is unlikely to proceed at a fast pace. It usually takes at least two years for the Census exercise to get completed. Many datasets take several years after the completion of the exercise to come out. — The delay in completing the 2021 Census could have damaging implications for a variety of sectors, and could potentially impact India's growth prospects as well. The Census exercise produces basic input data for all sorts of indicators used for planning and policy implementation. These indicators are also used for investment and trade decisions by global partners. In the absence of reliable indicators, based on solid numbers from the Census, the quality of these decisions could suffer.

Discuss. 1. MCQ: With reference to Census in India, consider the following statements: 1. Census is conducted by the Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner, Ministry of Home Affairs. 2. The Image based form processing technology (using ICR/OCR) was introduced for the first time in India for processing census 2011 data. Which of the above statements are not true? (a) Only 1 (b) Only 2 (c) Both 1 and 2 (d) Neither 1 nor 2 State of the Global Climate report 2022 WHY IN NEWS? — The world's glaciers melted at dramatic speed last year, with global sea levels rising at double the pace they did two decades ago, a UN climate report said on Friday, ahead of Earth Day. — The report released on Friday shows that record levels of heat-trapping by greenhouse gases is causing large-scale changes to the land, ocean and the atmosphere. KEY TAKEAWAYS — The WMO State of the Global Climate report 2022 focuses on key climate indicators – greenhouse gases, temperatures, sea level rise, ocean heat and acidification, sea ice and glaciers. It also highlights the impacts of climate change and extreme weather. 1. Drought, floods and heatwaves affect large parts of the world and the costs are rising 2. Global mean temperatures for the past 8 years have been the highest on record 3. Sea level and ocean heat are at record levels – and this trend will continue for many centuries 4. Antarctic sea ice falls to lowest extent on record 5. Europe shatters records for glacier melt Deutsche Welle writes: — The UN's World Meteorological Organization said saving glaciers was now effectively a lost cause. The annual report also recorded sea levels rising at an annual average of 4.62 millimeters in the past decade. — The report said the years between 2015-2022 were the warmest on record. The heatwave which struck Europe last summer caused more than 15,000 deaths. — The melting rate of some European glaciers was also “off the charts,” according to the report, with some glaciers losing up to 1.3 meters (4.3 feet) of average thickness between October 2021 and October 2022. “We have already lost this melting of glaciers game and sea level rise game so that's bad news,” WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas told a press conference. This is due to the high level of greenhouse gases which have already been emitted, causing water to continue to rise for “thousands of years.” Record high temperatures — The La Nina cooling weather phenomenon failed to ease the temperature hikes, with the past eight years considered the highest mean temperatures on record. — In 2021, greenhouse gas concentrations peaked. Carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration was at 415.7 parts per million globally, which is 149 per cent of the pre-industrial level. Methane meanwhile stood at 262 per cent and nitrous oxide at 124 per cent. 2022 data suggested they continued to increase. — Oceans were meanwhile the warmest on record. Some 58 per cent of ocean surfaces experienced a marine heatwave, the WMO said. “Around 90 per cent of the energy trapped in the climate system by greenhouse gases goes into the ocean, somewhat ameliorating even higher temperature increases but posing risks to marine ecosystems,” a summary of the report read. — Taalas predicted the extreme weather patterns to continue into the 2060s, even with successful mitigation steps, due to the damage already done. He said however that with enough effort, things could take a turn for the better afterwards. “The good news would be that we would be able to phase out this negative trend and even reach the 1.5 degrees (Celsius) limit,” he said. “We have the tools, the knowledge, and the solutions. But we must pick up the pace. We need accelerated climate action with deeper, faster emissions cuts to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. We also need massively scaled-up investments in adaptation and resilience, particularly for the most vulnerable countries and communities who have done the least to cause the crisis,” WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas, in a press statement. FYI: What else you should know? Earth Day 2023 — Every year, April 22 is celebrated as Earth Day, an annual event where people take time out to demonstrate their support for protecting the planet and its environment. — For 2023, the theme for Earth Day is “Invest in our planet,” calling for people and businesses to work together towards building a healthy economy for the planet. — According to EarthDay.org, which coordinates Earth Day events globally, the theme for the 2023 Earth Day calls on humanity to build a healthier economy while also making sure we work towards a more equitable future for everyone. — For this to happen, businesses, inventors, investors, and financial markets should lead the way by encouraging green innovation and practices. The private sector holds incredible power that can be wielded to bring about significant large-scale changes. — Governments must also do their part by incentivising citizens, businesses and other institutions to work towards this framework of an equitable and sustainable global system. Individual citizens of the planet can do their part with their votes and their wallets—by voting for politics that puts environmental conservation at the forefront and by buying from businesses that do the same. What is Earth Day, and how did it come about? — The first Earth day was celebrated more than 50 years ago on April 22, 1970. In a 2019 interview with Time, Denis Hayes, the man who organised the first Earth Day, explained how the event came to be. — A number of environmental issues came to the forefront of public debate in the late 60s. Rachel Carson published her seminal book Silent Spring in 1962, which could be thought of as the “first shot in the war over the environment.” — Not long after, in 1969, the Santa Barbara oil spill brought about visual imagery of environmental destruction to people. They saw animals covered in oil and saw them die on camera. Decades before the Bellandur lake in Bengaluru began routinely catching fire, in 1969, the Cuyahoga River in the United States caught fire. — The seemingly dystopian imagery of water set ablaze added fuel to the fire of a public outcry over environmental destruction. All of this was also happening at a time when America was building massive interstate highways when even people who were not environmental activists were raising concerns about their neighbourhoods being polluted by the tailpipe emissions of cars. — In a 1969 UNESCO conference, peace activist John McConnell proposed a day to honour the Earth and the concept of peace. The organisation selected March 21 next year to celebrate this day, planning for it to coincide with the vernal equinox, which marked the first day of spring. — Just a month after the United Nations proposal, US Senator Gaylord Nelson proposed that such a day be set aside for Americans to focus on similar issues. The senator reached out to Hayes to build the staff to organise the movement. — They selected the date of April 22 because, according to The Weather Channel, it was the “perfect intersection of fair springtime weather and suitability for a college student's semester schedule.” — A large number of the team working with the senator and Hayes were college students, and April 22 in 1970 fell on a Wednesday, which was the middle of the week, meaning that most college students would be on campus. The event was a wild success with more than 20 million Americans participating, according to some estimates. — That date stuck, and we now celebrate Earth Day on April 22 every year, irrespective of which day of the week it falls on.

MCQ: “Climate Action Tracker” which monitors the emission reduction pledges of different countries is a (2022) : (a) Database created by coalition of research organisations (b) Wing of “International Panel of Climate Change” (c) Committee under “United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change” (d) Agency promoted and financed by United Nations Environment Programme and World Bank LGBTQ rights in India: Key Supreme Court verdicts that trace the shift in law WHY IN NEWS? — The Supreme Court continued to hear a batch of pleas seeking legal recognition for same-sex marriages. The court heard arguments on the changing legal landscape on LGBTQ rights and the evolution of the right to choose one's partner. — Here are some of the key cases that trace the shift in the law over the years. CASE JUDGEMENT/ RULING NALSA v Union of India Months after a two-judge Bench of the Supreme Court in ‘Suresh Koushal v Union of India’ upheld the constitutional validity of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, another Bench in April 2014 affirmed the constitutional rights of transgender persons under Articles 14, 15, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. In ‘NALSA’, the Court agreed with virtually the same arguments it rejected in Suresh Koushal. The court upheld the right of transgender persons to decide their gender and directed the Centre and state governments to grant legal recognition to their gender identity, such as male, female or the third gender. KS Puttaswamy v Union of India In 2017, a nine-judge Bench of the Supreme Court unanimously recognised the right to privacy as a fundamental right under the Constitution. In doing so, the verdict overruled a “discordant note which directly bears upon the evolution of the constitutional jurisprudence on the right to privacy” — the 2013 ‘Suresh Koushal’ ruling. “The view in Koushal that the High Court had erroneously relied upon international precedents “in its anxiety to protect the so-called rights of LGBT persons” is…in our view, unsustainable. The expression “so-called” seems to suggest the exercise of a liberty in the garb of a right which is illusory. This is an inappropriate construction of the privacy based claims of the LGBT population. Their rights are not “so-called” but are real rights founded on sound constitutional doctrine. They inhere in the right to life. They dwell in privacy and dignity. They constitute the essence of liberty and freedom. Sexual orientation is an essential component of identity. Equal protection demands protection of the identity of every individual without discrimination,” a concurring opinion by Justice DY Chandrachud stated. Shafin Jahan v Union of India The SC in March 2018 set aside a Kerala High Court judgment that annulled the marriage of a 24-year-old woman who converted to Islam and married a man of her choice. The ruling recognised the right to choose one's partner as a facet of the fundamental right to liberty and dignity. Shakti Vahini v Union of India A three-judge Bench on the SC in March 2018 issued directives to prevent honour killings at the behest of khap panchayats and protect persons who marry without the approval of the panchayats. In the ruling, the Court recognised the right to choose a life partner as a fundamental right. Navtej Johar v Union of India In August 2018, the SC heard a curative petition against the ‘Koushal’ ruling. A five-judge Constitution Bench struck down IPC Section 377 to the extent that it criminalised homosexuality. The ‘Navtej’ ruling essentially said that the LGBTQ community are equal citizens and underlined that there cannot be discrimination in law based on sexual orientation and gender. Deepika Singh vs Central Administrative Tribunal The SC in August last year decided in favour of a woman who was denied maternity leave for her first biological child on the ground that she had already availed the benefit for her two non-biological children. The ruling recognised “atypical” families, including queer marriages, which could not be confined in the traditional parenting roles. (Source: Key Supreme Court verdicts that moved the needle on LGBTQ rights in India) Point to ponder: Recently, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) opposed the granting of adoption rights to same-sex couples and claimed that doing so is akin to “…endangering the children”. Comment. 3. MCQ: Which Article of the Constitution of India safeguards one's right to marry the person of one's choice? (2019) (a) Article 19 (b) Article 21 (c) Article 25 (d) Article 29 Critical minerals supply chains: challenges India faces WHY IN NEWS? — A recent working paper from Centre for Social and Economic Progress (CSEP) extends the earlier minerals assessment for 23 minerals by assessing the criticality levels of 43 select minerals for India based on their economic importance (demand-side factors) and supply risks (supply-side factors) which are determined through the evaluation of specific indicators. KEY TAKEAWAYS Rajesh Chadha, Ganesh Sivamani, Karthik Bansal Explain: — Critical minerals refer to mineral resources, both primary and processed, which are essential inputs in the production process of an economy, and whose supplies are likely to be disrupted due to the risks of non-availability or unaffordable price spikes. To tackle such supply risks, major global economies periodically evaluate which minerals are critical for their jurisdiction through a quantitative assessment. — Minerals such as antimony, cobalt, gallium, graphite, lithium, nickel, niobium, and strontium are among the 22 assessed to be critical for India. Many of these are required to meet the manufacturing needs of green technologies, high-tech equipment, aviation, and national defence. — However, while India has a significant mineral geological potential, many minerals are not readily available domestically. Hence, India needs to develop a national strategy to ensure resilient critical minerals supply chains, which focuses on minerals found to be critical in this study. What are the challenges? — India faces global and domestic challenges in assuring resilient critical minerals supply chains. On the international front, there currently exist four significant risks. 1. China, the most dominant player in the critical mineral supply chains, still struggles with Covid-19-related lockdowns. As a result, the extraction, processing and exports of critical minerals are at risk of slowdown. 2. Russia is one of the significant producers of nickel, palladium, titanium sponge metal, and the rare earth element scandium. Ukraine is one of the major producers of titanium. It also has reserves of lithium, cobalt, graphite, and rare earth elements, including tantalum, niobium, and beryllium. The war between the two countries has implications for these critical mineral supply chains. 3. As the balance of power shifts across continents and countries, the critical mineral supply chains may get affected due to the strategic partnership between China and Russia. As a result, developed countries have jointly drawn up partnership strategies, including the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) and G7's Sustainable Critical Minerals Alliance, while developing countries have missed out. 4. Manufacturing renewable energy technologies would require increasing quantities of minerals, including copper, manganese, zinc, and indium. Likewise, the transition to electric vehicles would require increasing amounts of minerals, including copper, lithium, cobalt, and rare earth elements. However, India does not have many of these mineral reserves, or its requirements may be higher than the availability, necessitating reliance on foreign partners to meet domestic needs. What is the way forward? — On the domestic front, while India has a geological potential similar to mining-rich Western Australia, much still needs to be explored. India faces four significant challenges to enable their sustainable extraction. 1. Many critical and strategic minerals constitute part of the list of atomic minerals in the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) (MMDR) Act, 1957. However, the present policy regime reserves these minerals only for public sector undertakings. Some of these are minerals and ores bearing beryllium, lithium, niobium, titanium, tantalum, zirconium, beach sand minerals, and rare earth group minerals containing uranium and thorium. 2. Given the increasing importance of critical and strategic minerals, there is an imperative need to create a new list of such minerals in the MMDR Act. The list may include minerals such as molybdenum, rhenium, tungsten, cadmium, indium, gallium, graphite, vanadium, tellurium, selenium, nickel, cobalt, tin, the platinum group of elements, and fertiliser minerals such as glauconitic, potash, and phosphate (without uranium). These minerals must be prospected, explored, and mined on priority, as any delays may hinder India's emissions reduction and climate change mitigation timeline. 3. The reconnaissance and exploration of minerals must be encouraged, with particular attention given to deep-seated minerals. This will call for a collective effort by the government, ‘junior’ miners, and major mining companies. 4. An innovative regime must be devised to allocate critical mineral mining assets, which adequately incentivises private explorers, including ‘junior’ explorers. Given the long lead times of setting up new exploration, extraction, and processing activities, these issues must be addressed soon if India is to utilise its natural wealth for its manufacturing needs. 5. India needs to determine where and how the processing of minerals and assembly of critical minerals-embedded equipment will occur. Currently, India relies on global supplies of various processed critical minerals, as there are limited domestic sources. — India requires a critical minerals strategy comprising measures aimed at making the country AatmaNirbhar (self-reliant) in critical minerals needed for sustainable economic growth and green technologies for climate action, national defence, and affirmative action for protecting the interests of the affected communities and regions. — In addition, India must actively engage in bilateral and plurilateral arrangements for building assured and resilient critical mineral supply chains. Furthermore, the assessment of critical minerals for India needs to be updated every three years to keep pace with changing domestic and global scenarios. — A national critical minerals strategy for India, underpinned by the minerals identified in this study, can help focus on priority concerns in supply risks, domestic policy regimes, and sustainability. (Source: What are the challenges India faces in assuring resilient critical minerals supply chains? by by Rajesh Chadha, Ganesh Sivamani, Karthik Bansal) Point to ponder: India's exclusion from US-led critical minerals alliance points to lack of expertise.

	//     "text": "By Hoimi Mukherjee The May 7 elections in Chile to elect members of a Constitutional Council marked another step in the two-year-long Constitution-making process aimed at replacing the current one. The Constituent Process was initiated under very different circumstances and the current circumstances raise questions on whether the original demands of the public will be met. In October 2019, massive social unrest across Chilean cities occurred after subway fares were increased by thirty pesos. The confrontation between student activists and police over metro station occupation, turnstile jumping and other civil disobedience turned violent. The damage to public property and police excesses led to common people joining the protests and demanding repealing the 1980 Constitution. The slogan “It is not thirty pesos, but thirty years” of the protests centred on the socio-economic distress attributed to the 1980 Constitution's neoliberal framework. Specifically, the subsidiarity principles between the private and public sectors are entrenched in the Constitution, where the former has a greater heft. This shaped Chile's private individualised pension system that provides bare subsistence to a large section of Chileans, its privatised healthcare system premised on the insurance that makes it unaffordable for the working classes and the voucher system in education for affording private education. The traditional political parties across the political spectrum were not responsive and the larger political class was caught unaware of such discontent; hence it was characterised as a “sudden”, “social explosion”, or a “social outburst”. To control the movement, President Sebastián Piñera sanctioned the use of force under a state of Emergency, which resulted in police excesses which angered the public further. Also ReadLithium cartelisation, strategic impact and Indian response In mid-November, political parties across the spectrum held backdoor meetings with the President of the Senate and decided on an ‘Agreement for Social Peace and New Constitution’. These meetings included independents and other prominent organisations, even though many civil society groups were not invited. This agreement created a Technical Committee that would draft amendments to the existing Constitution for its abolition. These amendments were included by the end of December in line with popular demand and pointed to three aspects that conditioned the end of the 1980 Charter. First, a referendum was to be conducted on whether they wanted to retain the 1980 Constitution or repeal it and whether they mandated Congress to draft the new Constitution or a fully elected Constituent Assembly The second aspect was outlining the process to elect new members to the Constituent Assembly/Convention if supported in the referendum. Third, voting on the draft Constitution formulated by the chosen body would end the referendum and repeal the 1980 Constitution. In October 2020, seventy-eight percent of the population voted for a new Constitution and seventy-nine per cent supported creating a Constituent Assembly. The Assembly was to have 155 members on parity rule and seventeen seats were reserved for indigenous people. Additionally, timelines for drafts, extensions and voting rules within the Assembly were enumerated. In May 2021, Chilean citizens elected the members of the Assembly, with Independents securing 103 seats, amounting to over sixty-six per cent of the total. Traditional Left parties secured only seventeen per cent of the seats and the right-wing parties secured one-third of the seats, pointing to the disenchantment with traditional politics. Professor Javier Couso commented that the assembly comprised largely of Leftists, many of whom were linked to civil society organisations leading the 2019 protests. The drafting was marked by contentions among various factions and disinformation campaigns, yet the two-thirds vote for quorum and acceptance of provisions regulated the document's drafting process containing 388 articles. Concomitantly, Presidential elections were conducted in a polarised environment in November 2021, where the two leading candidates had contrasting views about drafting a new Constitution. The Far-Right Presidential Candidate, Jose Antonio Kast of the Christian Social Front, advocated the retention of the 1980 Constitution, while Gabriel Boric of Apruebo Dignidad was a leader of the 2019 protests, was present at the 2019 Agreement for a New Constitution and naturally favoured drafting of the New Constitution. The overlap of the two political processes influenced the agenda of the elections and the content of the Constitution was put on the vote. Upon Boric's victory in 2021 and his assumption of office in March 2022, Boric extended support to the draft constitution's progressive content and aligned his governmental programme closely to it. There were speculations about the contents, extensive influencing of public opinion and disinformation campaigns over traditional and social media. The President received the draft constitution from the Assembly in July 2021 and declared September 4, 2022, as the date of the referendum for voting on the Constitution. The draft Constitution was deemed a progressive document that identified Chile as a social democratic, plurinational, intercultural and ecological state. In addition to redefining the nature of the state, it outlined an expansive state through provisions for a national public health system, a social security system and free higher education. Supporters and opponents of the draft formed the “approve” and “reject” blocs and campaigned extensively and the government aimed to educate the public on the provisions. Also ReadIndia set for LNG deal-making rush in win for Modi's gas push With voting made compulsory, the draft was rejected by around sixty-two percent of the thirteen million eligible voters. The results were attributed to poor communication, misinformation campaigns,massive funding by the “reject bloc”, a referendum on Boric's government and a lack of addressing the original demands, among others. This halted the Constitution-making process until January, when the political parties resumed it through a new Agreement for Chile. Successive public opinion exercises by Espacio Público (November 2022), Cadem (December 2022) and Activa (January 2023) show high support for a new Constitution. The New Agreement mandates a prominent role for Congress in the Constitution making. Congress approved the constitutional reforms under the Agreement for Chile and were signed by the Presidentand published in the government bulletin on January 17, 2023. Subsequently, Congress appointed twenty-four members to an Experts’ Committee based on principles of parity and share of representation in Congress. Simultaneously, Congress formed an Admissibility Committee upon similar representational rules, having fourteen members. The Experts’ Committee is tasked with making the preliminary draft while the Admissibility Committee monitors adherence to twelve basic principles in the draft that all parties in the Agreement for Chile accepted. The Congress also codified rules of the Constitution making, including the provision of approval and rejection of draft articles requiring a three-fifths majority in the proceedings. The Constitution Council would take the process further by working on the draft prepared by the Experts’ Committee. The fifty-member council is popularly elected with one seat reserved for the indigenous and will have five months to prepare the final draft. On May 7, elections for the seats in the Constitution Council Took place, of which twenty-three seats went to the Far-Right Republican Party and eleven seats to a coalition of centre-right Safe Chile. The Centre Left Unity for Chile secured sixteen seats which effectively allows the conservative majority to veto progressive social reforms as those included in the 2022 draft. The reasons for such diametrically opposite results include the persistence of disinformation, Chile's economic crisis and Boric's low approval ratings. Furthermore, the momentum behind the 2019 protests has slowed, and many termed the 2022 draft too progressive. Sociologist Camilo Godoy points out that the 2019 uprising was a catharsis against the neoliberal system, but the de-ideologised society did not alter its political consciousness significantly enough to embrace the alternative to neoliberalism. These developments indicate that the future of this process may not be propitious: There may be an impending conflict between President Boric's official agenda and the far-right parties' influence in the Constitution-making process. The Far-Right parties have opposed drafting a new Constitution and endorse retention of the older one; hence their role within this Council is to be seen. In June, the Experts Committee will provide a preliminary draft which the Council will use as their base. Across June and July, citizens will be allowed to participate by submitting proposals, hearings, dialogues with the Council and online consultation. In October, the Council is scheduled to present its first draft to the Experts' Committee and in case of disagreements, a committee of six members each from both bodies will be formed to resolve and harmonise. The final proposal of the Constitution will be delivered to the President on November 7. On December 17, 2023, this draft will be put forward for the Constitutional referendum for citizens to accept or reject, ending the second attempt at drafting a new Constitution.

	//     "title": "P Chidambaram writes: How we ‘work’ the Constitution",
	//     "text": "One of the oldest democracies in the world has a Sovereign (king or queen) but not a written Constitution, yet it is considered a model for other constitutional democracies. Britain's governance according to the ‘Constitution’ is superior to countries that have a written Constitution. Contrast countries like Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, etc. on the one hand and countries like China, Iran, Myanmar, etc. on the other. The V-Dem Institute placed the countries first mentioned at the top of the list of liberal democracies and the countries mentioned later were classified as closed autocracies. I think India falls in between. It has a written Constitution, a long one. Dr Ambedkar, his colleagues in the Drafting Committee and the Constituent Assembly took 2 years, 11 months and 17 days to complete the draft and adopt the Constitution. The Constituent Assembly debates are a model of democratic debate, dissent and decision-making. We Stumbled, Recovered We have worked the Constitution for 73 years. When Parliament found shortcomings — and sometimes even when it did not — Parliament amended the Constitution. There have been 105 Constitution Amendment Acts so far. Many legal scholars believe that the Constitution faced an overt and grave challenge when the Emergency was in force. There have been other instances when the Constitution faced covert challenges: the Constitution was dented, but it survived. When such occasions involved the Supreme Court of India, the Court may have stumbled, but recovered in due course. The Court proved that it possessed the humility to admit it was wrong. Examples when the Court stumbled are A.K. Gopalan, I.C. Golak Nath and A.D.M. Jabalpur. Examples when the Court corrected itself and asserted the fundamental principles of a liberal democratic Constitution are Maneka Gandhi, S.R. Bommai, Keshavananda Bharati and K.S. Puttaswamy. Covert Assault Some recent events have caused concern. In my view, they are covert assaults on the Constitution: On August 5, 2019, among other steps whose legality has been questioned, the State of Jammu & Kashmir was dismembered and two Union Territories were created. In a bizarre interpretation of the Constitution, Parliament consulted Parliament and after ‘obtaining’ the latter's ‘views’, Parliament reduced the State to two Union Territories. There is no guarantee that it will not happen to any other State in the future. On two occasions, the central government passed laws intended to deprive the Union Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) of the powers that it had enjoyed since 1992. On both occasions, the Supreme Court rebuffed the central government. In the monsoon session of Parliament, government enacted a law taking away the control of the elected ministers over government employees and vesting the control in the appointed Lieutenant Governor. The ministers have been placed at the mercy of the civil servants and the LG. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is a Constitutional body vested with vast powers. It holds the key to free and fair elections and to the renewal of our commitment to democracy every five years. In Anoop Baranwal, the Supreme Court created a mechanism that would ensure that a non-partisan body (Prime Minister, Chief Justice of India and Leader of the Opposition) selected the election commissioners. In a crude move, the central government set the judgement at nought and passed a law replacing the CJI by a Minister nominated by the prime minister. If the law will survive a legal challenge, it could alter the course of democracy in India. State legislatures pass Bills. Under Article 200 of the Constitution, the Governor may give assent to a Bill or withhold assent or reserve it for the consideration of the President. Some Governors do none of the above; they simply sit on the Bills. Likewise, on proposals to nominate persons to the Legislative Council, Governors sit on them. On petitions for disqualification of a member for violating the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, Speakers sit on the cases without deciding them. Does sitting on Bills or cases without exercising powers amount to working the Constitution? The latest assault on the Constitution is the situation in Manipur. The State has suffered a de facto division. No Kuki can enter the Imphal valley and no Meitei can enter the Kuki-dominated districts. The chief minister and his ministers cannot venture out of the neighborhood of their residences. After stalling initially, the Governor has summoned the legislative assembly to meet at Imphal, but the 10 Kuki members (out of 60 members) may not be able to attend the session. If this situation is not a ‘breakdown’ of the Constitution (and the chief minister is allowed to continue in office), Article 356 deserves to be erased from the Constitution. Ambedkar's Caution On November 25, 1949, Dr B R Ambedkar made his closing speech before the voting on the next day. He said, “However good a Constitution may be, it is sure to turn out to be bad because those who are called to work it, happen to be a bad lot. However bad a Constitution may be, it may turn out to be good if those who are called to work it, happen to be a good lot. The working of the Constitution does not depend wholly upon the nature of the Constitution.” Please ask yourself, are we working the Constitution or wrecking the Constitution?",

	//     "text": "It's an age-old debate that has got a fresh lease of life. And it all started with the 26-party Opposition bloc naming their alliance INDIA on Tuesday, sparking the Bharat vs India debate online. BJP leader and Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma was quick to tweet \"Congress for India, Modi ji for Bharat\". He was, however, quicker in deleting the tweet.Not the one to back down, Himanta changed his Twitter bio to Chief Minister of Assam, BHARAT, from earlier India. Why did HBS delete his original tweet which says Congress for India ?? Because that's the truth, truth will come out how much ever you try to suppress it Mr @himantabiswa ! Congress stands for ððððð âäï¸ð®ð³ pic.twitter.com/vsHqlQzCnM — Vijay Thottathil (@vijaythottathil) July 18, 2023 Himanta is just one of the politicians who have waded into the India vs Bharat debate. Politicians from both the ruling BJP and the Opposition have waded into it. In fact, the fathers of the Constitution too debated it extensively in the Constituent Assembly. Article 1 of our Constitution says: \"India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States.\" It is important to note that the Bharat versus India debate is not just about semantics but also about the broader question of national identity and representation.India had, for decades, seen skewed development between the perceived \"rural Bharat\" and \"urbanised India\". Recent government policies, like the assured rural employment scheme (MGNREGS), were aimed at correcting that. The debate reflects the ongoing struggle to balance the diverse identities and aspirations of India's population while maintaining a cohesive and inclusive nation. The resolution of this debate requires a nuanced understanding of history, culture, and the evolving dynamics of contemporary Indian society. THE HISTORY OF BHARAT VS INDIAThe Bharat versus India debate is a complex issue that stems from the historical, cultural, and political dynamics of the Indian subcontinent. It revolves around the naming and identity of the country, reflecting differing perspectives on its history, diversity, and national character. The debate has deep roots and has been a subject of contention for many years.The term \"Bharat\" has ancient origins and finds mention in various Hindu scriptures, such as the Mahabharata and the Manusmriti. It refers to emperor Bharata, who is believed to have ruled over a vast territory encompassing present-day India. Proponents of using \"Bharat\" argue that it reflects the deep-rooted cultural and historical heritage of the land.In the Puranas, 'Bharat' refers to the island of Jambudvipa -- a place which historians are unable to find a modern equivalent. Later, 'Bharat' was also seen as referring to a socio-cultural entity rather than a physical landmass.On the other hand, \"India\" is derived from the Indus River, which played a significant role in the region's early civilisations. The term was popularised by Greek historians and later adopted by the British during their colonial rule. Critics argue that \"India\" represents a colonial legacy and fails to capture the diverse identities and histories of the subcontinent's various regions.FREEDOM STRUGGLE AND THEREAFTERDuring the freedom struggle, leaders like Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru emphasised the idea of a united and inclusive India that transcended religious, linguistic, and regional differences. They saw \"India\" as a unifying force that could bring together the diverse communities of the subcontinent.However, after Independence, the question of national identity became a subject of intense debate. Some argued for the adoption of \"Bharat\" as the official name, highlighting its indigenous and cultural significance. Others favored \"India,\" citing its historical usage and international recognition. Ultimately, the Constituent Assembly of India settled on a compromise of using both names in Article 1 of the Indian Constitution, stating that \"India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States.\" India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and law minister BR Ambedkar were both in favour of retaining the name 'India' during the Constituent Assembly debates. (Credit: Getty Images)'COLONIAL LEGACY' AND 'INDIGENOUS ROOTS'Since then, the debate has continued to simmer, reflecting deeper issues of identity, regionalism, and linguistic diversity in India. Proponents of \"Bharat\" argue that it better represents the country's ancient \"heritage and indigenous roots\". They believe that using \"India\" perpetuates a colonial legacy and undermines the diverse cultural fabric of the nation.On the other hand, supporters of \"India\" contend that it is a pragmatic choice that \"reflects the country's global image and recognition\". They argue that 'Bharat' may \"exclude or marginalise non-Hindu communities\" and \"fail to capture the pluralistic nature of Indian society\". Some critics view the emphasis on 'Bharat' as a form of Hindu nationalism, which they believe \"undermines India's secular character\".The Bharat versus India debate has also become entangled with broader political narratives and ideological struggles in the country. YOGI ADITYANATH'S BILL AND WHAT THE SUPREME COURT RULEDThe debate has come up at regular intervals and has been invoked by various political entities and interest groups. In 2014, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who was then a Member of Parliament, moved a bill in the Lokh Saba and proposed that Article 1 of the Constitution be amended to replace 'India' with 'Hindustan'.“The world 'India' denotes the symbol of slavery and thus deserves to be omitted from our Constitution,” the bill stated. Interestingly, Yogi Adityanath wasn't present in the House to present the bill and that led to a buzz that the BJP brass had advised him to go slow on a politically sensitive issue.There also have been legal petitions and public discussions seeking to settle the debate definitively.In June 2020, the Supreme Court heard a plea case by a person named Namah who pleaded that the name 'India' be dropped from the Constitution and the country be referred to as 'Bharat'. The court rejected the plea.In 2016, the Supreme Court made a similar observation, with then Chief Justice of India TS Thakur saying every citizen had a right to choose what to call their country and a court shouldn't dictate such matters.OPPOSITION'S INDIA VS NDACut to July 2023 and the debate has got a fresh lease of life with the 26-party Opposition bloc choosing to call itself INDIA (Indian, National, Developmental, Inclusive, Alliance).Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma tweeted, \"Congress for India, Modi ji for Bharat\". He deleted the tweet.\"Our civilisational conflict is pivoted around India and Bharat. The British named our country as India. We must strive to free ourselves from colonial legacies. Our forefathers fought for Bharat, and we will continue to work for Bharat. BJP for BHARAT,\" he tweeted later. Our civilisational conflict is pivoted around India and Bharat.The British named our country as India. We must strive to free ourselves from colonial legacies. Our forefathers fought for Bharat, and we will continue to work for Bharat . BJP for BHARAT — Himanta Biswa Sarma (@himantabiswa) July 18, 2023 The BJP leader also changed his Twitter bio to reflect his stand on 'Bharat'.\"Surplus of sour grapes,\" the Congress scoffed, reminding Himanta Biswa Sarma of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pet schemes like 'Digital India' and 'Skill India'.Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari countered Himanta, tweeting: \"There is no civilisational conflict in India. Samuel Huntington & his Clash of Civilisations is a myth that even herculean efforts to validate would be an exercise in futility.\"\"Sorry BJP- appropriating “Bharat” & making it a Bharat vs India fight is the lamest trick in the book. Not going to get you anywhere...,\" tweeted Trinamool Congress leader Mahua Moitra. Sorry BJP- appropriating “Bharat” & making it a Bharat vs India fight is the lamest trick in the book. Not going to get you anywhere. Time for BJP's Bharat Todo Yatra to stop. — Mahua Moitra (@MahuaMoitra) July 18, 2023 Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday tried to project the BJP-led NDA as \"New India, Development, and Aspirations\". This came after a meeting of the NDA constituents in New Delhi.The Opposition INDIA alliance on Wednesday tried to take the edge by getting 'Bharat' too in its armoury. It chose 'Jeetega Bharat' as the tagline of the alliance after the furious India vs Bharat debate.\"What's in a name?\" some would ask. The Bharat versus India debate is a reflection of the complex historical, cultural, and political dynamics of the Indian subcontinent. It encompasses questions of identity, history, and national character, with proponents on both sides presenting compelling arguments. The debate, it seems, will play out as the country heads to the crucial 2024 general election. (With input from Aanya Niharika Schoetz) --- ENDS",

	//     "title": "Marriage Equality: Centre's View of the Constitution Is Flawed",
	//     "text": "In his 2018 book ‘A People's Constitution: The Everyday Life of Law In The Indian Republic’, Rohit De makes a strong case for the centrality of India's Constitution in the lives of its citizenry.As rights-bearing individuals, De argues, the people of India took this ‘public resource’ in the form of a Constitution to the Supreme Court, not for adjudication of some amorphous moral claim or State-endowed privileges, but for enforcement of indisputable and clearly coded guarantees of equality, freedom, and dignity in everyday life. Earlier this week, as the Solicitor General (SG) of India Tushar Mehta submitted before the Supreme Court that it was not the prerogative of the judiciary to grant marriage equality, the central government's line of argument betrayed an acute ignorance of the manner in which constitutional jurisprudence has evolved in India.'No Research To Prove Same-Sex Partners Are Inept Parents': Psychiatrists WriteHERE'S HOW:From the very inception of this litigation, the Centre has maintained that the demand for marriage equality does not enjoy the ‘popular will’. As per the written submissions of the Centre, on account of the doctrine of separation of powers, the question of marriage equality should be decided by the elected representatives – who enjoy the mandate of the people of India – or in other words, reflect the ‘popular will’ in their respective legislatures. While this appears to be a legitimate claim, it does not paint an accurate picture of our constitutional scheme, where judicial review by the constitutional courts serves as a formidable limitation on the law-making power of the legislature. It needs no greater emphasis that India's Constitution is a living document, that is to say, it takes into account the social realities of India and accommodates the lived experiences of its people. The framers did not think of the Constitution as an exhaustive, self-contained bill of rights; rather, it was devised as an enabling framework which could be interpreted and re-interpreted to balance competing interests. Making such a framework was not an easy task, as an arduous burden had to be discharged: a large number of marginalised interest groups, with diverse sets of grievances and demands, had to be given a stake in governance. Naturally, it was impossible to create an omnibus document which could account for all such demands. The Constitution was, therefore, formulated as a fluid document, the contours of which could be expanded to fit in the hitherto excluded groups. To what event can this ‘transformative’ nature of India's Constitution be attributed, one may ask. The answer lies in the origin of the document. The Indian Constitution was drafted in the wake of a nationalist struggle for independence. The subjects of an imperial power were adopting self-rule, and were transforming into citizens of a welfare state. The prevailing ideal of independent India was not the pre-eminence of the State – it was the superiority of the rights of its citizens.More importantly, the overarching thrust of this canopy of rights was creation of a ‘representative’ democracy in the true sense of the term, where even the smallest of minority occupy a seat at the table. Arguably, in the last 70 years or so, the Constitution has continued to be ‘transformative’. To borrow from Advocate Gautam Bhatia's ‘The Transformative Constitution: A Radical Biography in Nine Acts’, it has transformed not only the political relationship between the State and the individual, but also the social relationships upon which the law and polity operate. This is not only to the credit of the Constitution, but also its final arbiter: the Supreme Court of India. Quite like the Supreme Court of the Unites States of America, the Supreme Court of India also enjoys the power of ‘judicial review’. This means that the Supreme Court can call into question – and invalidate – any State action which falls foul of fundamental rights, or any other part of the Constitution. However...This has often happened by way of a liberal reading of the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution.In Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, the Supreme Court ruled that Article 14 of the Constitution not only prohibits State-sponsored discrimination, but also protects against any arbitrariness in executive action. Similarly, Article 21– which guarantees a fundamental right to life and personal liberty – has been expansively interpreted to include the facets of dignity, autonomy, and privacy. Relying upon these guarantees, the Supreme Court of India singlehandedly ushered in an environmental revolution in the 1980s, when right to clean and safe environment was upheld as an integral part of Article 21. During this time, the court also propounded and developed the ‘public interest litigation’ (PIL) regime, under which one could approach the Court for enforcement of fundamental rights of citizens who, due to reasons of access, poverty or lack of information, could not approach the Court themselves. Using the PIL jurisdiction, the Supreme Court struck down many ills: the scourge of bonded labour, release of prisoners incarcerated since eternity, and the right to free legal aid, to name a few. A striking feature of the Court's approach towards interpretation of fundamental rights has been its insistence on the ‘positive obligations’ of the State, and not a mere promise to not violate the fundamental rights. This means that the State, apart from not discriminating against a citizen through its own actions, has to further ensure that such citizen does not face discrimination from his fellow citizens. In a number of cases, the Supreme Court has applied this aspect of ‘horizontality’ of rights to dealings between private parties, in scenarios where there is power imbalance or where one private party is in a position to exploit the other. In Vishaka vs State of Rajasthan, the Supreme Court framed the famous guidelines against sexual harassment, since a legislative void attributable to the State exposed the petitioner to violation at the hands of private actors. Given that the Court has already recognised the fundamental right to autonomy and privacy of homosexual couples and persons who fall outside the male/female gender binary and has rendered such persons ‘equal’ under the eyes of law, there is no logical reason why their right to marriage should not be recognised under law. While reconciliation of personal laws to accommodate marriages other than a heterosexual union may be a legislative task, it cannot prevent an enabling declaration of marriage equality from the Supreme Court, one which will place the personal laws within the peripheries of Constitution as understood today. Insurance, Pension, Adoption: Lawyers Tell SC Why Same-Sex Marriages Are CrucialThe Indian Constitution does not operate on the whims of public morality. Be that as it may, it would be naive to suggest that unions in India have been visualised through heteronormative lenses alone.The modern understanding of heterosexuality and marriages embedded under Indian law is only a recent exercise in normative purity, having emerged as a pushback against the colonial exoticisation of diverse sexual practices in India. Even so, an overwhelming public sentiment against marriage equality cannot allow the Court to leave the question open for legislative deliberation.The Indian Constitution operates on, what is commonly known as ‘constitutional morality’, which is different from morality as understood in its ordinary sense.While the beliefs of the majority may be construed as ‘moral’, what does not pass the test of equality and dignity will not be moral per the constitution. For this reason, even if 99.9% of the people of India are opposed to the idea of marriage equality – as has been claimed by the Bar Council of India – it cannot deter the Supreme Court from upholding the rights of sexual minorities.The Constitution was not drafted to echo the views of the majority; it was intended to protect one citizen against the tyranny of the majority.

	//     "text": "AT PENPOINT It was perhaps symptomatic that the 1973 Constitution's Golden Jubilee's flagship event, the Constitutional Convention to mark its passage, held in the National Assembly's hall, was itself the subject of controversy, because one of the members of a constitutional body, a judge of the Supreme Court, Mr Justice Qazi Faez Isa, was not just present, but also spoke on the occasion. This was because the Supreme Court and Parliament are presently at daggers drawn, and engaged in a struggle for supremacy. Mr Justice Isa was the only judge present, even though the other members of the Supreme Court had been invited, and he was seated next to comeone who represented Parliament as no other man has done, or has done so far, Asif Ali Zardari. This was not because Mr Zardari leads the PPP, which 50 years ago was the sole party holding the reigns of government, or because his is an MNA, but because he is not just a former member of the Senate (1997-2000), but also the country's sole surviving ex-President (2009-2014). As such, he has at one time or another been part (as President the whole) of the three bodies that make up Parliament, and which are necessary to the legislative process. One of the issues plaguing the relations between Parliament and the Supreme Court is that Supreme Court (Procedures and Practices Act), which has been passed by Parliament, and which has been struck down in advance by the Supreme Court, and which the President refused to give his assent twice. Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the 1973 Constitution has been its resilience. Both the Martial Laws imposed before it, saw the existing Constitutions abrogated. The 1973 Constitution has been held in abeyance twice, but both times it was restored. Both times, the first Parliament to come into existence after that particular bout of military rule, passed an Amendment Act which introduced certain clauses which enhanced the powers of the President over the government. In 1958 and 1969, it seemed, the military was totally dissatisfied with the Constitution, and decided to get rid of the existing document and replace it with an entirely new one. However, in 1977 and 1999, it seems that Article 6 (high treason as the charge for abrogating the Constitution, and the death sentence as punishment) was a deterrent. While the coupmaker of 1977 died suddenly in office went his plane was blown up, the one of 1999 was brought to trial. How was awarded a death sentence, but it was never executed. The sentence was struck down by the Lahore High Court. However, the impunity with which the first three military rulers passed does not seem to be an example any more. It is perhaps appropriate at this point to note how it is creaking. Creaking is not necessarily a bad thing. Countries emerge stronger after crisis. However, the present crisis is such as to reduce confidence in a document which may have survived 50 years, but 20 of those years were under military rule, and the military was very influential the rest of the time. It is perhaps ironic that this Golden Jubilee is being celebrated in the midst of a crisis that has made it more disliked than it ever was under military rule. Though military dissatisfaction is with many things, the Constitution has been problematic for it. The military first tried to have a constitution of its own design, in the shape of the 1962 Constitution, which was presidential. It also included the provision that the Cabinet would always include one officer of the rank of lieutenant-general or equivalent. Another provision was that the president could only be impeached by two-thirds of the National Assembly, that an impeachment motion could only be brought by 51 percent of the members, and that it the motion failed, all those voting for it would lose their seats. The elections to the National Assembly and the Presidency were indirect, with a layer of Basic Democrats insulating the ordinary voter from his representatives. Yet even this Constitution was not good enough for the military, and was abrogated in 1969. Another of its provisions, the clubbing of all the provinces and princely states of West Pakistan, into one province of West Pakistan, as a sort of counterpoise to the single-provinces eastern wing of the country, was also reversed. Well, bot entirely, because the princely states stayed abolished, and were merged into the various provinces. The 1971 elections threw up a National Assembly and five provincial assemblies, even though a constitution remained to be written. The country broke first, and it was left to the National Assembly, split itself into two, to write separate constitutions for what had become two independent countries. It is thus perhaps ironic that the Constitution written for the rump Pakistan, the 1973 Constitution whose jubilee is being marked now, contained provisions that were deemed necessary for a united Pakistan. The Constitution as parliamentary, not presidential, meaning that the Chief Executive was elected by parliament, not the voters, and that the chief executive was merely the head of government, and not the head of state, which was to be a President, indirectly elected (by Parliament) and to have virtually no powers, always acting on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Constitution continued the break-up of One Unit, but now instead of East Pakistan, it was Punjab which became the province with the majority of seats. As happened in 1971 and 1996, one party won almost all of the seats in one province, and formed the government (in 1971 it was the Awami League in East Pakistan, in 1996, it was the PMLLN) in Punjab). It is perhaps worth noting that the division of powers between the federation and the provinces is not as relevant as the structures put in place, which have made it a federal rather than a unitary constitution. The 1962 Constitution did provide for two provinces, but while a provincial assembly was elected (indirectly, of course), the provincial governments were firmly under federal control. The governors and the cabinets held office at the pleasure of the President, which meant that the President also ruled both provinces. However, under the 1973 Constitution, provinces have been, from 1988 onwards, frequently been ruled by parties in the opposition at the Centre. One might come to think the Constitution came too late. The Six Points of Sh Mujeeb had required that the Pakistan centre restrict itself to the subjects of foreign affairs, defence, commerce and communication. That might sound like a radical programme for a loose confederation, but actually it was the basic scheme of the Indian Empire, and of the 1935 Government of India Act. It must not be forgotten that the 1935 Act formed the constitution of both India and Pakistan as amended by the 1947 Independence of India Act, passed by British Parliament. The part of the Central Assembly which comprised the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan, was empowered not just to pass a Constitution for Pakistan, but also to amend the Government of India Act as needed. Should it then be a surprise that the 1956 Constitution should be a reprise of the 1935 Act? Or that the 1956 Constitution inspired the 1973 Constitution? The 1973 Constitution is thus not so much a revolutionary document as a link in the chain of the British imposing their system on Pakistan. It must not be forgotten that the 1935 Act was not just passed from on high. There were three Roundtable Conferences, between 1930 and 1932, which provided major input. It is perhaps appropriate at this point to note how it is creaking. Creaking is not necessarily a bad thing. Countries emerge stronger after crisis. However, the present crisis is such as to reduce confidence in a document which may have survived 50 years, but 20 of those years were under military rule, and the military was very influential the rest of the time. It is perhaps ironic that this Golden Jubilee is being celebrated in the midst of a crisis that has made it more disliked than it ever was under military rule.",

	//     "text": "The Indian Constitution is a framework which governs the country and its citizens. In order to make it more detailed, it had to go through a lot of formative events, and these were the events which have received a remarkable position in Indian history. The Indian Constitution is unique in both spirit and content. Notwithstanding the fact that several features of the constitution have been borrowed from other constitutions from all around the world, it is really a unique piece of work. Two years, eleven months and seventeen days, was the time taken to draft the historic Constitution of independent India, which was adopted on November 26, 1949 and came into effect on January 2, 1950. The Constitution consists of 448 Articles in 25 Parts and 12 Schedules. The Beginning The beginning of the need to have a constitution can be traced back to 1919, which marked an important step in India's Constitutional development during the British Rule. These reforms were an attempt to address the demands of Indians for greater participation in governance and gradual self-governance. The British Parliament was presented with the Commonwealth Of India Bill, 1925 which demanded fundamental rights for Indians. These rights included: individual liberty, freedom of conscience, free expression of opinion, free assembly, and equality before law. In November 1927, the British government appointed the Simon Commission to review the working of the Government of India Act, 1919 and propose constitutional reforms for India. The Commission did not have a single Indian member, which annoyed leaders of nationalist movement. In response to the Commission, the Indian Congress passed a resolution to set up a committee, which later came to be known as the “Nehru Committee” after its chairman Motilal Nehru. The committee was formed for the purpose of drafting of “a Swaraj Constitution for India” The Nehru Report The report was presented on 15th august, 1928, proposed a new dominion status for India. Major Components of the Nehru Report were, Bill of Rights, assigning equal rights to all genders as citizens, formation of a federal form of government with residuary powers in the hands of centre, and proposal for the creation of Supreme Court. The report received various responses; the issue of communal representation was controversial. Many Muslim leaders suggested 1/3rd representation of Muslims in the Central Legislature. Representation to Muslims in Punjab and Bengal in proportion to their populations, formation of three new provinces with a Muslim majority. However, the Hindu Mahasabha was opposed to the formation of the new provinces and the communal representation in Bengal and Punjab. They pressed for a strictly unitary system. The Constituent Assembly 1934 was when the inception of a constituent assembly was first put forth by the pioneer of the Communist Movement, M. N. Roy, followed by the Indian National Congress. In 1936, the Indian National Congress held its session at Lucknow, which was presided by Jawaharlal Nehru. The official demand of the constituent assembly was raised and was rejected as it imposed the Constitution which was against the will of Indians. Later on 15th November, 1939, Rajagopalachari voiced the demand for a constituent assembly based on adult franchise, which was accepted by the British. The August Offer Viceroy Linlithgow, on 8th August 1940, made a statement promising the expansion of the Executive Council of the Viceroy of India to include more Indians. It gave more weight to minority opinion and recognised the rights of the Indians to frame their own Constitution. This was known as The August Offer. However, the Indian Congress could not trust the British government's intentions. Linlithgow, proposed resolving the Indian constitution after the war through a constituent committee meeting at Wardha. February, 1946 Cabinet Mission was a high-powered mission sent in February 1946 to India by the Atlee Government. The mission had three British cabinet members – Pethick Lawrence, Stafford Cripps and AV Alexander. The Cabinet Mission's aim was to discuss the transfer of power from British to Indian leadership. However, the mission failed as the Congress party wanted a strong centre with minimum powers for the provinces whereas, the Muslim League wanted strong political safeguards for the Muslims like parity in the legislatures. Since both parties had many ideological differences and could not find common ground, the mission came up with its own set of proposals in May 1946. December 1946 When India was on the verge of getting its freedom, the constituent assembly met for the very first time with an aim to frame an unbiased constitution, which would later be known as the world's lengthiest constitution. The constituent Assembly consisted of three-hundred members, and was headed by Dr Rajendra Prasad. Later on, August 29th, 1947 a drafting committee was established under the chairmanship of Dr BR Ambekar, to come up with the draft of the constitution. After repeated debates, arguments, addition and deletion of clauses, the constitution was finally adopted on November 26th ,1949 with 284 signing members. The assembly ceased to exist from the 26th day of January, 1950, and the constitution was finally applicable. Long Process Framing of the Constitution was a long and tedious process. The Framers of our constitution framed every word of the constitution with careful deliberation and discussions, which has resulted into one of the world's greatest constitutions till date. The Indian constitution is the supreme law of our nation, it is adopted by our people as stated in its preamble.
